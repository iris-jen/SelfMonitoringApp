# Log Yourself
Create a variety of logs to keep track of your day to day life. This can be helpful for recognizing the associations between behavior and well being.

The user fills out information on their day to day life through a series of text logs

Logs that can be created
- Mood
- Sleep
- Meal
- Activity
- Substance
- Socialization
The information can be viewed in daily summary cards.

Future improvements include
- Taking and saving photos to logs
- Reminders
- Goal setting / user data analytics
